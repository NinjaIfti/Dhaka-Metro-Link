## Architecture Guidelines

### 1. Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based organization with a clean architecture approach:

```
lib/
├── core/                 # Core functionality
│   ├── constants/        # App constants
│   ├── theme/            # App theming
│   └── utils/            # Utility functions
├── data/                 # Data layer
│   ├── models/           # Data models
│   └── repositories/     # Repository implementations
├── domain/               # Business logic
│   ├── entities/         # Domain entities
│   └── repositories/     # Repository interfaces
└── presentation/         # UI layer
    ├── pages/            # App screens
    └── widgets/          # Reusable widgets
```

### 2. Coding Standards

#### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `MetroCard`, `JourneyService`)
- **Variables/Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `cardNumber`, `getUserJourneys()`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or camelCase based on scope
- **Files**: snake_case (e.g., `metro_card.dart`, `journey_repository.dart`)

#### Code Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Keep methods short and focused
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

#### UI Guidelines
- Separate business logic from UI code
- Extract reusable widgets into their own classes
- Maintain consistent styling using the app theme
- Ensure responsive layouts for different screen sizes

### 3. State Management

- Use stateful widgets for simple local state
- Consider Bloc pattern for complex state management
- Keep state management consistent across the app
- Document state flows for complex interactions

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Optimize list rendering with `ListView.builder`
- Use lazy loading for data-intensive screens
- Minimize widget rebuilds with `const` constructors
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data

### 5. Error Handling

- Implement proper exception handling
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Add retry mechanisms for network operations
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 6. Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Create widget tests for UI components
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Use mocks and stubs for dependencies
- Aim for good test coverage especially for critical features
